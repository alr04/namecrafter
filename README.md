## NameCrafter
Project for CSI 2999

## Description

NameCrafter is an online app that helps users come up with names based on Chaldean numerology traits. Instead of just looking up what existing names mean, NameCrafter lets users type in traits they want like personality vibes or life path numbers and get name ideas that match those traits.

## Motivation

The idea for NameCrafter came from wanting to dive into the interesting world of Chaldean numerology and make a fun tool for finding names. We wanted users to have a cool way to pick names that matched their personality, blending old-school numerology with an easy-to-use platform.

## Problem Solved

This project fills the gap where there aren’t many interactive numerology tools that let users create names based on personal traits, instead of just explaining names that already exist. NameCrafter makes it more interesting for users by giving them a new, fun way to explore different name options.

## Lessons Learned

While working on NameCrafter, we learned a lot about Chaldean numerology, using Django, building RESTful APIs, and designing user-friendly interfaces. This project pushed us to create a cool experience that combines cultural history with today’s tech.
